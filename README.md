# recipe_suggestor
This scrip will suggest a random recipe from the list of recipes that it has access to.

The user can add more recipes thru the program.

The suggested recipe can be totally random or random with a specific ingredient included in it.

Upon opening the program, the user can add as many recipes as he wants, or ask for a recipe, provided that recipes are in the database.
